Here's a high-frequency crosshole seismic tomography experiment. Field data set is acquired at a 105 m span (mainly sedimentary rocks). Source main frequencies contain 0.4k, 0.6k, 0.8k and 1.1kHz.
Data size: [n, m]. n means the number of sampling points. m equals to 2112, i.e., 66 shots * 32 receivers. The depth of sources is 10 to 75m with a 1 m interval and the depth of receivers is in the filename also with a 1 m interval.
